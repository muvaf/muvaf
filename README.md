🏗 I try to develop backend systems with simplicity and reliability in mind.

✨ The tools I'm using to do that right now are Go, Kubernetes, Controller Runtime and various cloud provider APIs.

I work at [Upbound](https://www.upbound.io/) where I'm a maintainer of [Crossplane](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane), an open source control plane that lets you build your own infrastructure platform, its various providers like [provider-aws](https://github.com/crossplane/provider-aws) and code-generation tooling to generate Kubernetes controllers like [Terrajet](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/terrajet).

[Prior](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmonus/) to that, I worked at SAP to build the cloud backend of [Data Intelligence](https://www.sap.com/products/data-intelligence.html) and interned at Amazon to make ML pipelines run more efficient.
